  %nWelcome to Habitat Simulation v0.1!
    
  Using the application you may run simulations in various habitat types with a number of animal species and see which animal species are the masters of their environments.
  
  Tips for using the application:
  - Whenever you are asked to enter an input from a list of options, do not feel compelled to enter it in the same letter case, i.e. if the application writes 'SAVANNAH' you are more than welcome to type it out as 'savannah'.

  Type 'Start' to start the simulation programme with a number of instructions and setting a few configuration values!
  Type 'Exit' if you ended here by accident and would like to leave!%n
